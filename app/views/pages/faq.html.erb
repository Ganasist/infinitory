	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<br>

	<h2>General</h2>

	<h3>Why use Infinitory?</h3>
	<h4>Infinitory lowers your operating costs by reducing reagent waste and redundancy, improving device saturation and making it easier for lab members to know exactly what is going on with the things they need.
	</h4>

	<h3>What is Infinitory?</h3>
	<h4>Infinitory is a real-time lab inventory management system. It gives labs the ability to build, maintain and monitor a catalog of reagents and devices. Targeted notices are automatically sent to members when their reagents are running low, expiring soon or re-ordered by another person. Members are also notified when their devices breakdown or are repaired.
	</h4>

	<h3>Who can use Infinitory?</h3>
	<h4>Any lab or institute engaged in scientific research.</h4>

	<br>
	<h2>Integration</h2>

	<h3>How should our lab begin using Infinitory?</h3>
	<h4>It is <i>highly</i> recommended that you: 
		<br> 1) Establish a simple location code for the shelves, fridges and freezers in your lab.
		<br> 2) Set aside one day to perform an initial global inventory. Add devices and reagents you wish to track, skip anything else.
		<br> 3) Your lab members need to spend only a few minutes each day maintaining the established catalog afterwards.
	</h4>

	<h3>Should we add and track even common items to our inventory?</h3>
	<h4>You may add anything you wish, however Infinitory is intended for items that have a significant value. Cheaper items that are easy to procure might not be worth tracking.</h4>

	<h3>What happens if some lab members never update their activity?</h3>
	<h4>Infinitory is most effective when everyone contributes their share to prevent records from becoming stale. To address this concern, Infinitory awards points to members when they create, delete or update anything. This score is displayed on member pages and over time it will be obvious who is <a href="#nerd_modal" data-toggle="modal">contributing</a> and who <a href="#einstein_modal" data-toggle="modal">isn't</a>.</h4>

	<br>
	<h2>Pricing</h2>

	<h3>How much does Infinitory cost?</h3>
	<h4>Infinitory is free for the first 3 months, then labs are billed â‚¬8 ($11) per member per month. Labs can track an unlimited number of reagents and devices.
	</h4>

	<h3>How secure is your payment system?<h3>
	<h4>We employ <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank"> Braintree <small><%= fa_icon 'external-link' %></small></a>, a recognized third party service, to handle credit card payments. Your credit card data is never stored on our servers and information is transmitted over an <a href="#braintree_modal" data-toggle="modal">encrypted</a> channel to Braintree, part of what makes Infinitory <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank">PCI compliant <small><%= fa_icon 'external-link' %></small></a>.
	</h4>

	<h3>Can Infinitory really save my lab money?</h3>
	<h4>Absolutely! During the 3 month free trial most labs will enjoy a significant jump in efficiency and productivity, far in excess of what Infinitory costs. Labs that don't see an improvement can simply quit.
	</h4>

	<br>
	<h2>Privacy</h2>

	<h3>Does Infinitory store experimental data?</h3>
	<h4>No. We only store data related to your lab's members, devices and reagents.
	</h4>

	<h3>Can random people see my lab's inventory?</h3>
	<h4>No. In order to access your inventory a person must:
		<br> 1) Have a confirmed Infinitory account & belong to your lab or
		<br> 2) be a registered member of a linked lab.
	</h4>

	<h3>Can I selectively pool my inventory with other labs?</h3>
	<h4>Yes. Items added to Infinitory are private by default. To pool with other labs you must do two things:
		<br> 1) Group leaders must explicitly link their labs together in the lab settings menu. Only group leaders have this ability.
		<br> 2) Lab members must manually set specific items to 'shared' in order for linked labs to access them.
		<br><br>Shared items can <i>only</i> be accessed by your linked labs and are inaccessible to other labs.</h4>
